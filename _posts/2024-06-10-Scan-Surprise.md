## Challenge

I've gotten bored of handing out flags as text. Wouldn't it be cool if they were an image instead?
You can download the challenge files here:

## Solution

This one is too simple to be called a CTF challenge. The steps to get the flag are pretty straightforward:
- Download the challenge files
- Extract the files
- Open the extracted folders until you get a QR code
- Scan the QR code to get your flag!

It's that simple!
