## Challenge

People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags. I want to make sure they get the real thing! I'm going to provide the SHA-256 hash and a decrypt script to help you know that my flags are legitimate.
You can download the challenge files here:
- [challenge.zip](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_rhea/22/challenge.zip)

## Solution

We have been provided with the following data:
- challenge.zip - A zip file
- checksum.txt - sha256 checksum of correct flag file
- decrypt.sh - Decryption program

### Download and extract

Download and extract the challenge files. It contains decryption program, correct checksum and some files

### Hashing

Go to the drop-in directory in the extracted folder. Calculate the hash value of each file given in the files/ folder and filter out the file which has the correct checksum value. 

```bash
for file in files/* ; do
sha256sum $file | grep "55b983afdd9d10718f1db3983459efc5cc3f5a66841e2651041e25dec3efd46a"
done ;
```

This bash script iterates over each file in the files/ directory, calculates its sha256 hash and matches with correct hash value.

This will return the filename which contains the real flag. the file "2cdcb2de" was found correct for me

### Finding flag on server instance

Now if you try to decrypt it using decrypt.sh, it won't work. The decrypt.sh works on absolute address of the file, so we need to create and instance on picoCTF.
Login into the created instance using ssh, and run this following command:

```bash
./decrypt.sh files/2cdcb2de
```

That's it! You found the flag!
