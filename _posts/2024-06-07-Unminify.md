## Challenge

I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!
Browse here, and find the flag!

## Solution

The challenge is pretty straightforward, even if it seems confusing.

### Visit the webpage

Start an instance and visit the given link. The page says that the flag has been delivered. But it is not visible.

### View page source

On searching for the flag in the page source, it was easier that thought! The flag is given in plain form.
