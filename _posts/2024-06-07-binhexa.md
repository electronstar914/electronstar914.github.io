## Challenge

How well can you perfom basic binary operations?
Start searching for the flag here 'nc titan.picoctf.net 51947'

## Solution

The challenge simply tests your binary arithmetic skills with six simple operations. Then it checks your base conversion skills
If you know binary calculations, then this writeup is not for you. For those new to binary data:
- Go to any online base converter website
- Convert the given two binary numbers to decimal
- Calculate the answer in decimal
- Convert it back to binary and submit

For left shift by x bit, multiply the decimal number by 2^x
For right shift by x bit, divide the decimal number by 2^x and get the quotient

At last convert the answer of last question to hexadecimal using the same site that you used in step 1
